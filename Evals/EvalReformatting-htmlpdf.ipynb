    "In the end, we want a nice looking PDF document. There are quite a few tools for generating PDFs. The most popular is [reportlab](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/reportlab) (people seem to recommend reportlab's [platypus](http://www.reportlab.com/apis/reportlab/2.4/platypus.html) for \"simple\" pdf [generation](https://www.reportlab.com/docs/platypus-example.py)). I wanted something a little easier to control. I thought about using [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax) document (see [CommonMark](http://commonmark.org/)) as intermediate format, and using [python-markdown2](https://github.com/trentm/python-markdown2) to generate HTML and [xhtml2pdf](https://github.com/chrisglass/xhtml2pdf) to generate the PDF (similar to what is [done](https://omz-forums.appspot.com/pythonista/post/6427727661891584) [here](https://gist.github.com/SpotlightKid/0efb4d07f28af1c8fc1b)). In the end, it seemed easier to just write out the simple HTML myself. Similarly, I thought about [Sphinx](http://sphinx-doc.org/) with [reStructuredText](http://docutils.sourceforge.net/rst.html), but that needs a working LaTeX environment to produce PDFs.\n",

    "\n",
    "In this case, we need to know the structure of the XLS documents. There should be two sheets. The first (called \"RawData\") contains columns like \"Path\" \"CourseCode\" etc. and then \"Question_1\", \"Question_2\" etc. The second (called \"QuestionMapper\") contains \"Question 1\" etc. in column A and the text of the question in column B.\n",

       "        <p class=\"answer\">piazza was, consistently, either a hit or a miss. some days, i would feel like i either had a lot of questions about the material or could post a comment that would be helpful to others. other days, i really struggled with posting something that would be beneficial to others and would find myself posting a comment raving about how the textbook was set up. ultimately, i left the class with mixed feelings about piazza, but i think it wasn't the most helpful because, even if i did have a question on piazza and, if that question got answered, i often wouldn't know about it until the next time i logged on (which, then, my question would have been answered in class, one way or another). overall, i feel that the challenge problems were helpful, but my feelings towards the current challenge problem, and challenge problems, in general, really depended week by week. some weeks, i felt that the challenge problems were doable, and, other weeks, i felt that they added a lot of time to my workload, causing more stress. handouts were informative when they were given out! if anything, next time, have more handouts!!</p>\n",

       "        <p class=\"answer\">overall pretty good with notes that we could follow and especially the visual displays were often helpful. i would suggest maybe doing more visual displays, if it's not possible for the professors to do it themselves, maybe show youtube videos as an example.</p>\n",

       "        <p class=\"answer\">especially towards the end (thermodynamics), go over the readings a little more and in general spend a little more time on that section, because that is the one thing that i don't really think i understand.</p>\n",
