    "In the end, we want a nice looking PDF document. There are quite a few tools for generating PDFs. The most popular is [reportlab](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/reportlab) (people seem to recommend reportlab's [platypus](http://www.reportlab.com/apis/reportlab/2.4/platypus.html) for \"simple\" pdf [generation](https://www.reportlab.com/docs/platypus-example.py)). I wanted something a little easier to control. I thought about using [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax) document (see [CommonMark](http://commonmark.org/)) as intermediate format, and using [python-markdown2](https://github.com/trentm/python-markdown2) to generate HTML and [xhtml2pdf](https://github.com/chrisglass/xhtml2pdf) to generate the PDF (similar to what is [done](https://omz-forums.appspot.com/pythonista/post/6427727661891584) [here](https://gist.github.com/SpotlightKid/0efb4d07f28af1c8fc1b)). In the end, it seemed easier to just write out the simple HTML myself. Similarly, I thought about [Sphinx](http://sphinx-doc.org/) with [reStructuredText](http://docutils.sourceforge.net/rst.html), but that needs a working LaTeX environment to produce PDFs.\n",

    "\n",
    "In this case, we need to know the structure of the XLS documents. There should be two sheets. The first (called \"RawData\") contains columns like \"Path\" \"CourseCode\" etc. and then \"Question_1\", \"Question_2\" etc. The second (called \"QuestionMapper\") contains \"Question 1\" etc. in column A and the text of the question in column B.\n",

       "        <p class=\"answer\">this course is super fun and interesting. my favorite aspect was the lab because it was interactive, and as complicated as some lessons were, they were made so much easier to understand through those labs. kyle is also an excellent professor in that he interacts well with everyone, even though my lab section was slightly packed with students.</p>\n",

       "        <p class=\"answer\">i think that if this course was not offered at 8am, more students would have done better. i completely understand that we students complain too much about mornings, but i do think that since astronomy lectures are a little more dense that other lecture subjects, it might be a good idea to change the lecture to a later time. i think students would soak up more information if it weren't so early.</p>\n",

       "        <p class=\"answer\">personally, i noticed that on the written homework assignments, exam questions, etc. that kyle's wording was particularly confusing. i think this could be solved if he ran the questions by a student before handing them out. this would make a huge difference when answering questions of such complicated subject matter. or at least, i know it would have made it much easier for me to understand exactly what kind of information he was looking for.</p>\n",

       "    <p class=\"question\">What were the most positive features of this course?</p>\n",
       "        <p class=\"answer\">i think that the most positive feature of this course was the lab. it was really nice to explore the ideas we were learning about in class, i am a visual learner, and it was really helpful to complete the labs because it helped me to fully understand the ideas. simply learning about the topics in a lecture setting may work for some people, but for me, the most positive feature of the course was the fact that it catered to different types of learners. another positive feature of the course was the pace at which it was taught. it was fast enough that we did not focus too heavily on one part, but it was slow enough that i was able to fully understand the material presented.</p>\n",

       "        <p class=\"answer\">the design was great, like i said, the pace was perfect, and the clicker questions dispersed though the lecture helped keep interest up. the only mild criticism i have is the text book, i rented it, and i have not had to use it once. i felt that this was a complete waste of money. i really appreciated the fact that we had an entire week in which to complete our homework assignments. i think it helped us learn and review a greater expanse of the material.</p>\n",

       "        <p class=\"answer\">the assignments and materials for this course were very minimalist. the one thing we had to remember to bring was the clicker, and we only had one homework assignment a week. this was nice because it meant there wasn't much to do, though i was a litle unhappy that, because of the time we recieved the homework, and the topics that were on it, we couldn't complete it sooner than the tuesday after we recieved it. i thought the course was well designed as well, class in the morning, lab in the afternoon, pretty straight forward, not hard to follow.</p>\n",
