    "# Strategy\n",

    "There are quite a few tools for generating PDFs. The most popular is [reportlab](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/reportlab) (people seem to recommend reportlab's [platypus](http://www.reportlab.com/apis/reportlab/2.4/platypus.html) for \"simple\" pdf [generation](https://www.reportlab.com/docs/platypus-example.py)).\n",
    "\n",
    "[Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax) document (see [CommonMark](http://commonmark.org/)) is a great intermediate format, so we could make one of those and then convert it to PDF. If that's the desired route, we'll probably use [python-markdown2](https://github.com/trentm/python-markdown2) to generate HTML and [xhtml2pdf](https://github.com/chrisglass/xhtml2pdf) to generate the PDF (similar to what is [done](https://omz-forums.appspot.com/pythonista/post/6427727661891584) [here](https://gist.github.com/SpotlightKid/0efb4d07f28af1c8fc1b)). xhtml2pdf does depend on reportlab, which is a bit of a downside, but not too bad. Another option is to use [pdftk](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pdfkit) which wraps [wkhtmltopdf](http://wkhtmltopdf.org/).\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, I thought about [Sphinx](http://sphinx-doc.org/) with [reStructuredText](http://docutils.sourceforge.net/rst.html), but that needs a working LaTeX environment to produce PDFs.\n",
    "\n",
    "A previous version of this script directly used reportlab/platypus. \n",
    "\n",
    "At the moment, I think the only really important output is the HTML/CSS which gets converted to PDF. So, instead of going through Markdown or reStructuredText, I'm just going to spit out my own HTML/CSS. I'll then feed it through one of the HTML/CSS --> PDF conversion chains."

    "# Parsing the Excel\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a few good Excel parsers these days, but [pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/) is nice and standard. It also understands XLS files in addition to XLSX, which is important since we don't want to make people convert to XLSX by hand in order to use a different parse.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, we need to know the structure of the XLS documents. There should be two sheets. The first (called \"RawData\") contains columns like \"Path\" \"CourseCode\" etc. and then \"Question_1\", \"Question_2\" etc. The second (called \"QuestionMapper\") contains \"Question 1\" etc. in column A and the text of the question in column B.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first row is a header in both cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "I have no idea how fragile this structure is, so I'll explicitly refer to the sheets by name. That way, there's a decent chance this script will break if someone changes the underlying format."
